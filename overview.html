					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						<ul>
							<li>“Collecting data on my working group takes me too long and is hard to do. How can I make this more efficient and be sure that gained data is reliable and complete?”</li>
							<li>“How can I effectively track our research activities to share useful information all around the world?”</li>
							<li>“Why should I show only a part of my scientific productivity and consequently be assessed on this partial data?</li>
							<li>“I desire to get a more granular breakdown of an organization level. How can I identify the group of work activities?”</li>
							<li>“I need to detect researchers operating around the world to encourage collaboration and corporate partnerships. How can I achieve best results with a minimum effort?”</li>
							<li>“I want to benchmark my organizations against its peers, and my working group also want to benchmark themselves. How can we do this effectively to suit our different realities?”</li>
							<li>“I need to know how large is a peer group in order to normalize the outputs with the actual number of involved researchers. How to know the size of a working group around the world? ”</li>
							<li>“Which is the best way to show our unique strengths in order to secure funding and attract talents?”</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>For Developers</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Scientilla is a freely downloadable software that enables organizations and researchers to share through internet their bibliographic metadata and let  the most reliable version of each publication description emerge thanks to a ranking algorhythm that orders the entire set of references by comparing them and counting similar/identical ones.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						In other words the system allows every user to download in their machine the bibliographic metadata shared by others and automatically hide the noise relative to reference copies that are affected by typing mistakes and other errors. It is able to do that because each publication description is often, if not always, reported by more than one researcher or organization with its own version and probably the most correct and complete is the one that has been written more times in the exact same way.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Scientilla has been developed as a P2P (Peer to Peer) tool, which means each user can directly connect to someone else's installation to freely view, and eventually copy, their list of public bibliographic metadata. The architecture is not based on a central web server but relies instead on the multitude of installations where each one is identified by an URL and is then clearly reachable and responsible for what is shared.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						In other words the network is made up of all software copies installed all around the world by organizations and researchers. The Scientilla-running computers form a grid of equally privileged nodes, each one publicly exposing the bibliographic information configured from the relevant owner, that in normal cases should fit with their scientific production.
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						Scientilla allows  an installation owner to configure the list of their shared references  using different modalities. One consists of manual insertion through a fillable form. Another concerns the search, copy and eventually correct references (cloning) from other nodes. The last concerns the import of publications from files in different formats or to integrate them from web services that are available on user's local networks or on the internet. 
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						In each installation the following rules are then applied:
					</p>
					<p class="text-justify">
						When a new reference is added to the list of an installation, eithr manually or importing/integrating the data, this is memorized together with an hash string calculated on  the complete text of the publication description and called original_hash. When instead an already existing reference is copied from another node, that is stored with the original_hash of the source plus another hash string recalculated after any corrections and called clone_hash.
						Every time a reference is saved or updated it is also supplied with an additional hash string calculated on the profile data of the user that requested its creation. This extra information is called user_hash. By disallowing the existence of more than one publication with the same user_hash and original_hash the system is able to ensure that for each installation there can be only one reference for the same organization or researcher.
						When a shared reference is collected from another installation it is saved together with the source URL from which data are coming.
